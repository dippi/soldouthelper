A pragmatic approach

Choosing the right library or tool is a time consuming activity.
You have to fit requirements, tech stack, team background and more.
//PDF generation is no different, some of the libraries are language specific, other force to rebuild your design from the ground up with geometric primitives (canvas like api).
HTML to PDF is an pragmatic approach to the problem.
It let you reuse the technologies that you already know (HTML, CSS and JS).
With yakpdf you just need one API call.


Saas

Creating PDF is as easy as printing a webpage in your browser&mdash;behind the scenes we do just that!
You could do the same, if you haven't already, check out the [puppeteer](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer) project.
There is a drawback though, you have to deploy and maintain your own instances of Chromium, which is known to be greedy for resources.
With a vertical focus on this task alone, we invested our time perfecting our infrastructure. We rely on AWS cloud to deliver a robust, fast and scalable service.

We invested our time to make our infrastructure robust and scalable (aws), so you don't have to.
